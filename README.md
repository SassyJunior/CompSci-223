###Class Description
***Computer Science 223: Data Structures in C***

This is a new course to the academy that provides cadets the ability to learn the C programming language. Given that most of the students have never taken a course on C, it starts from the basics of and walks them through to working with Heaps. Any questions about the course should be directed to the Computer Science department at the United States Air Force Academy.

Prior to this course, most of the students have had experience with either RAPTOR or Processing. All students are required to take a class using Python so there is an assumption for the basic structure of programming.
